# 🎮 Simon Game Challenge

This is a web-based memory game inspired by the classic **Simon Game**, built as part of [Angela Yu's Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

The game tests your memory by generating a sequence of colors that you must repeat in the correct order. With each level, the sequence gets longer!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the pattern of blinking buttons and sounds.
3. Repeat the exact sequence by clicking the buttons.
4. Each level adds one more color to the sequence.
5. A wrong click ends the game — press a key to restart!
